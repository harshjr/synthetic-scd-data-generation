# Synthetic Data Generation for SCD Patients

## Project Overview
This project generates synthetic data for Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) patients using statistical methods.

## Methods Used
1. **Parametric Method**: Independent sampling from fitted distributions for each variable
2. **Multivariate Normal Method**: Preserves correlations between numerical variables
3. **Gaussian Mixture Model**: Captures complex distributions and relationships

## Results
The evaluation results can be found in the 'results/evaluation' directory.
Synthetic datasets are available in the 'results/synthetic_data' directory.

## Conclusion
Based on the evaluation metrics, the most suitable method for generating synthetic SCD patient data is [to be determined based on evaluation results].
